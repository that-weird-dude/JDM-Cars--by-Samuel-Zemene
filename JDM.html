        <h1>The History Of JDM (Japan Domestic Market)</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="history-of-JDM">
        The term JDM originally represented cars sold primarily in Japan, but it
        has come to mean any high-performance Japanese model, whether a new or
        used car sold exclusively in Japan or in multiple global markets,
        including the U.S. and Canada. <br /><br />
        That started to change in the 1980s, as sporty two-door coupes like the
        Honda Prelude, Mazda RX-7, Nissan 240SX, and Toyota Supra and Celica
        joined the Nissan 300ZX in U.S. showrooms. But the real pivot toward JDM
        vehicles came in the 1990s, when magazines like Sport Compact Car and
        Super Street focused on the growing enthusiasm for Japanese ‚Äútuner cars‚Äù
        and the enthusiast culture forming around them. The Acura Integra, Honda
        Civic, Mitsubishi Eclipse, and Nissan 240SX were among the most common
        models featured in these magazines. <br /><br />

        models featured in these magazines. <br /><br />
        By the early 2000s additional JDM models had made the leap to U.S.
        showrooms, including the all-wheel-drive Subaru Impreza WRX STI and
        Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (or Evo). The Honda S2000, a new
        rear-wheel-drive sports car with a 6-speed manual transmission and 9,000
        rpm redline, added to the momentum, as did a little movie called The
        Fast and The Furious. <br /><br />
        This relatively low-budget, performance-car-themed film put a heavy
        emphasis on JDM cars sporting numerous aftermarket car parts. Honda
        Civic and Mitsubishi Eclipse variants, utilizing large spoilers and
        nitrous oxide, along with true JDM cars like the right-hand drive Nissan
        Skyline GT-R, helped validate the film with JDM fans. The Fast and The
        Furious was a huge box-office success, inspiring more than 10
        sequels/spin-offs, and popularizing terms like nitrous oxide,
        supercharger, and twin turbo.
        <br /><br />
        While most automotive enthusiasts still wouldn't put JDM cars on the
        same plane as European supercars from BMW,s M Sport group, Ferrari,
        Mercedes-AMG, or Porsche, there,s no denying the rising interest, and
        market value, of the following JDM classic cars.

          <p class="supra">
            Initially a Japanese market Celica spin-off model, the Toyota Supra
            went on sale in the U.S. in 1980 and by 1994 it offered a powerful
            twin-turbo 2JZ engine making over 320 horsepower. Toyota ended U.S.
            sales in 1998 but continued sales in Japan until 2002. A new Supra,
            developed largely by BMW, debuted in 2020.

          <p class="GT-R">
            An all-wheel-drive, turbocharged coupe, the Skyline GT-R was never
            officially sold in the U.S., though many Japan-market GT-Rs have
            been imported and are easy to spot with their steering wheel on the
            right side. The modern Nissan GT-R is the first official version of
            the Skyline GT-R sold in the U.S.

            engine-powered sports car that was manufactured and marketed by
            Mazda from 1978 until 2002 across three generations, all of which
            made use of a compact, lightweight Wankel rotary engine.
