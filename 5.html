    <h1>Honda NSX</h1>
    <p>
      The Honda NSX, marketed in North America as the Acura NSX, is a two-seat,
      mid-engined coupe sports car manufactured by Honda. <br />
      <br />

      The origins of the NSX trace back to 1984, with the HP-X (Honda
      Pininfarina eXperimental) concept, which was a mid-engine 3.0 L V6 engine
      rear wheel drive sports car. Honda committed to the project, with the
      intention of meeting or exceeding the performance of the then V8 engine
      Ferrari range, while offering reliability and a lower price point. The
      concept thus evolved and had its name changed to NS-X, which stood for
      "New", "Sportscar" "eXperimental", although the production model was
      launched as the NSX. <br />
      <br />

      Gordon Murray, the designer of the McLaren F1 supercar, stated that he
      used the NSX as the inspiration for the F1 after test driving many high
      performance cars and finding the NSX chassis performed the best. Murray
      stated that the design was "monumental" to sportscar design. He found that
      the car could easily have handled more power and attempted to convince
      Honda to develop a more powerful engine, but they declined. This resulted
      in Murray developing the F1 with a BMW engine, but he was so fond of the
      NSX that he bought one for personal use and drove it for 75,000 km. Murray
      stated that the NSX was "dear to his heart".
    </p>
    <h2>The NSX has 2 generations</h2>
    <h3>but we ain't gonna talk about the 2nd gen</h3>

    <h1>First Gen(NA1/NA2; 1990)</h1>
    <p>
      The NSX was designed by a team led by Chief Designer Masahito Nakano and
      Executive Chief Engineer Shigeru Uehara. It benefited from advanced
      aerodynamics and styling inspired by an F-16 fighter jet cockpit and input
      from the late Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna during the final
      development stages. <br />
      <br />

      This NSX became the world's first mass-produced car to feature an
      all-aluminium body. It was powered by an all-aluminium 3.0 L V6 engine,
      which featured Honda's VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic
      Control) system developed in the 1980s, a 5-speed manual transmission, or
      starting in 1994 the SportShift 4-speed automatic transmission, also known
      as F-Matic, which allows the option of conventional automatic shifting or
      manually shifting with a fingertip shift lever on the steering column.
      <br />
      <br />

      It was presented at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show and was built in a
      purpose-made factory in Japan, for sale from 1990. It was originally
      available as a coupÃ© and, from 1995, a targa top. It underwent a
      performance upgrade in 1997, which saw the arrival of a larger 3.2 L V6
      engine, and a facelift in 2002 where the pop-up headlights were removed.
      The first generation NSX was discontinued in 2005. North American models
      were sold as the Acura NSX. <br />
      <br />

      Cars with the 3.0 L C30A engine are referred to as NA1 models, while the
      3.2 L C32B engine cars are known as NA2 models.
