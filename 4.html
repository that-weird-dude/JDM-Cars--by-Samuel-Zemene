    <h1>Mazda RX-7</h1>
    <p>
      The Mazda RX-7 is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, rotary engine-powered
      sports car that was manufactured and marketed by Mazda from 1978 until
      2002 across three generations, all of which made use of a compact,
      lightweight Wankel rotary engine. <br />
      <br />

      The first generation of the RX-7, SA (early) and FB (late), was a
      two-seater 2 door hatchback coup√©. It featured a 12A carbureted rotary
      engine as well as the option for a 13B with electronic fuel injection in
      later years. <br />
      <br />

      The second generation of RX-7, known as the FC, was offered as a 2-seater
      coup√© with a 2+2 option available in some markets, as well as in a
      convertible bodystyle. This was powered by the 13B rotary engine, offered
      in naturally aspirated or turbocharged forms. <br />
      <br />

      The third generation of the RX-7, known as the FD, was offered a
      2+2-seater coup√© with a limited run of a 2-seater option. This featured a
      sequentially turbocharged 13B REW engine. <br />
      <br />

      More than 800,000 were manufactured over its lifetime.

    <h3>
      But the most common and well known gen is the 3rd gen, so we're gonna talk
      about that
    </h3>
    <h2>Third Gen (FD3S)</h2>
    <p>
      The third generation RX-7, FD (chassis code FD3S for Japan and JM1FD for
      the North America), featured an updated body design. The 13B-REW was the
      first-ever mass-produced sequential twin-turbocharger system to be
      exported from Japan, boosting power to 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp) in 1992 and
      finally 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) by the time production ended in Japan in
      2002. <br />
      <br />

      The chief designer was Yoichi Sato (‰ΩêËó§ Ê¥ã‰∏Ä, Sat≈ç Y≈çichi). Another key
      designer was Wu-huang Chin (Áß¶ÁÑ°Ëçí), a Taiwanese automotive artist who
      also worked on the Mazda MX-5 Miata. <br />
      <br />

      In Japan, sales were affected by this series' non-compliance with Japanese
      dimension regulations and Japanese buyers paid annual taxes for the car's
      non-compliant width. As the RX-7 was now considered an upper-level luxury
      sports car due to the increased width dimensions, Mazda also offered two
      smaller offerings, the Eunos Roadster, and the Eunos Presso hatchback.
      <br />
      <br />

      The sequential twin turbocharging system, introduced in 1992, was
      extremely complex and was developed with the aid of Hitachi. It was
      previously used on the exclusive-to-Japan Cosmo JC Series. The system used
      two turbochargers, one to provide 10 psi (0.69 bar) of boost from 1,800
      rpm. The second turbocharger activated in the upper half of the rpm range,
      during full throttle acceleration ‚Äî at 4,000 rpm to maintain 10 psi (0.69
      bar) until redline. The changeover process occurred at 4,500 rpm, with a
      momentary dip in pressure to 8 psi (0.55 bar), and provided semi-linear
      acceleration from a wide torque curve throughout the entire rev range
      under normal operation. <br />
      <br />

      Under high speed driving conditions, the changeover process produced a
      significant increase in power output and forced technical drivers to
      adjust their driving style to anticipate and mitigate any over-steer
      during cornering. The standard turbo control system used 4 control
      solenoids, 4 actuators, both a vacuum and pressure chamber, and several
      feet of preformed vacuum/pressure hoses, all of which were prone to
      failure in part due to complexity and the inherent high temperatures of
      the rotary engine. <br />
      <br />

      A special high-performance version of the RX-7 was introduced in Australia
      in 1995, named the RX-7 SP. This model was developed to achieve
      homologation for racing in the Australian GT Production Car Series and the
      Eastern Creek 12 Hour production car race. An initial run of 25 cars were
      made, and later an extra 10 were built by Mazda due to demand. The RX-7 SP
      was rated at 277 PS (204 kW; 273 hp) and 357 N‚ãÖm (263 lb‚ãÖft) of torque, a
      substantial increase over the standard model. Other changes included a
      race-developed carbon fibre nose cone and rear spoiler, a carbon fibre 120
      l (32 US gal) fuel tank (as opposed to the 76 l (20 US gal) tank in the
      standard car), a 4.3:1 final drive ratio, 17-inch wheels, larger brake
      rotors and calipers. A "three times more efficient" intercooler, a new
      exhaust, and a modified ECU were also included. Weight was reduced
      significantly with the aid of further carbon fibre usage including
      lightweight vented bonnet and Recaro seats to reduce weight to 1,218 kg
      (2,685 lb) (from 1,250 kg (2,756 lb)) making this model road-going race
      car that matched the performance of the rival Porsche Carrera RS Club
      Sport for the final year Mazda officially entered. The formula paid off
      when the RX-7 SP won the 1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour, giving Mazda the
      winning 12 hour trophy for a fourth straight year. The winning car also
      gained a podium finish at the international tarmac rally Targa Tasmania
      months later. A later special version, the Bathurst R, was introduced in
      2001 to commemorate this victory in Japan only. It was based on the RX-7
      Type R and 500 were built in total, featuring adjustable dampers, a carbon
      fibre shift knob, carbon fibre interior trim, special fog lamps and a
      different parking brake lever. <br />
      <br />
      In the United Kingdom, for 1992, customers were offered only one version
      of the FD, which was based on a combination of the US touring and the base
      model. For the following year, in a bid to speed up sales, Mazda reduced
      the price of the RX-7 to ¬£25,000, down from ¬£32,000, and refunded the
      difference to those who bought the car before that was announced. From
      1992 to 1995, only 210 FD RX-7s were officially sold in the UK. The FD
      continued to be imported to the UK until 1996. In 1998, for a car that had
      suffered from slow sales when it was officially sold, with a surge of
      interest and the benefit of a newly introduced SVA scheme, the FD would
      become so popular that there were more parallel and grey imported models
      brought into the country than Mazda UK had ever imported.
