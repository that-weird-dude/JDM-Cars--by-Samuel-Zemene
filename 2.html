      <h1>Toyota Supra</h1>
      <p class="about">
        The Toyota Supra (Japanese: ãƒˆãƒ¨ã‚¿ãƒ»ã‚¹ãƒ¼ãƒ—ãƒ©) is a sports car and grand
        tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978.
        The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to
        surpass" or "go beyond". <br />
        <br />
        The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to
        2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went
        on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from
        the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider. Starting in
        mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In
        turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car
        Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is
        frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and
        third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in
        Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the
        Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is
        assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an
        inline-6 layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct
        descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were
        also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, Toyota
        also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the
        original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used
        until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was
        similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without
        the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when
        Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. The dragon logo was a
        Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first
        two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota
        Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also
        discontinued. <br /><br />
        In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth generation of the Supra in
        the United States. Production of the fourth generation of the Supra for
        worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth generation
        of the Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 Z4, was introduced.

        But the most popular of these are the <u>mk4 A80 Supra</u> and the
        <u>mk5 A90 Supra</u>.
      </h3>
      <h1>About the mk4 Supra</h1>
      <p class="mk4">
        The A80 program began in February 1989 under various teams for design,
        product planning, and engineering led by Isao Tsuzuki. By the middle of
        1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi was
        approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules
        were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the first
        A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991. <br />
        <br />
        Again using subframe, suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the Z30
        Soarer (Lexus SC300/400), pre-production of the test models started in
        December 1992 with 20 units made, and official mass production began in
        April 1993. The fourth generation of the Supra again shared its platform
        with the upscale Soarer coupe, sold in the U.S. as the Lexus SC.
        Although the two cars looked similar dimension-wise, the new Supra was
        more than 13 inches (340 mm) shorter than its luxurious cousin.
        <br /><br />
        This redesign saw Toyota placing great emphasis on a more serious
        high-performance car. The A80 featured two new engines: a naturally
        aspirated Toyota 2JZ-GE having a power output of 164 kW (220 hp; 223 PS)
        at 5,800 rpm and 210 lbâ‹…ft (285 Nâ‹…m) at 4,800 rpm of torque and a twin
        turbocharged Toyota 2JZ-GTE having a power output of 206 kW (276 hp; 280
        PS) and 318 lbâ‹…ft (431 Nâ‹…m) of torque for the Japanese model. For the
        export model (American/European markets) Toyota upgraded the Supra
        turbo's engine (by installing smaller, steel wheeled turbochargers and
        bigger fuel injectors, etc.). This increased the power output to 239 kW
        (321 hp; 325 PS) at 5,600 rpm and 315 lbâ‹…ft (427 Nâ‹…m) of torque at 4,000
        rpm (243 kW (326 hp; 330 PS) and 325 lbâ‹…ft (441 Nâ‹…m) for European
        markets) Upon its launch in 1993, it was the first Toyota-badged vehicle
        to include a passenger airbag as standard (US-market only).

      <h1>About the mk5 Supra</h1>
      <p class="mk5">
        The fifth-generation Supra was released in January 2019 after 17 years
        off the market as the GR Supra, part of Toyota's Gazoo Racing (GR)
        family of performance cars. It was developed in partnership with BMW,
        sharing the platform and many parts from the BMW Z4 (G29) with BMW
        derived 4- and 6-cylinder turbocharged engines and maintaining
        rear-wheel drive layout from the previous Supra. The model is designated
        with BMW model codes "J29" or "DB", however Toyota used the "A90" and
        "A91" codes for promotional and marketing materials for the
        fifth-generation Supra to maintain the lineage from the previous Supra.
        The GR Supra is manufactured at the Magna Steyr plant in Graz, Austria
        alongside the Z4. <br /><br />
        The fifth-generation Toyota Supra was launched in total seven color
        options including CU Later Gray, Stratosphere, Burnout, Absolute Zero,
        Nocturnal, Renaissance 2.0, and Nitro Yellow. Apart from the cosmetics,
        in the year 2023, new driving modes are introduced called Hairpin+. This
        modes allows additional wheel-spin on one of the rear tire to help
        rotate the Supra around ultra-tight hairpin turns.
